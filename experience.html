        <h2>Relevant Experience</h2>
        <p>Literally none to speak of!  I found <a href="www.teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a> shortly after I had enrolled in Skillcrush's Break into Tech Program.  Although both programs present really well, Team Treehouse had more of the hand-holding I feel like I need.  I did work both programs concurrently but ultimately paused Skillcrush to pursue the Tech Degree here at Team Treehouse!</p>
        <p>I have explored other avenues as well:
            <ul>
                <li>Mimo is an iOS app -loved it!</li>
                <li>Code with Mosh -he has a great YouTube presence, really terrific content!</li>
                <li>Udemy has a free HTML/CSS course that I found valuable</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
